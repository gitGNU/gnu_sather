SYSTEM CLASSES

The system library is separated out since some portions of this library
are not available on all systems. Check the 
SATHER_HOME/Systme/Platforms/<your system>/Platform.module 
to see what is installed on your platform. <your system> refers to
the name of the platform on which you have installed Sather.
Most things will work on most unix systems, but may require, for 
instance, tcl/tk to be installed.

An extremely useful routine in sys.sa is SYS::ob_eq, which
performs an object-identity equality test.  (In other words,
is it exactly the same object, as opposed to another object which
has the same fields.)  Many of the container classes use this notion
of equality if the contained class does not provide an equality
test of its own.

The TEST class makes it convenient to build test classes for other
classes with uniform reporting.  Please use it to build your test
code.
