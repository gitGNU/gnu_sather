bootstrap - This is the C code for a bootstrap Sather compiler.  The 
            code was generated with GNU Sather so it will be hard to 
            read.  This code is licensed under GPL v3, or later.

compiler  - This is the source code for the GNU Sather compiler in 
            Sather, of course.  This code is licensed under GPL v3, or 
            later.

runtime   - This is the GNU Sather runtime.  It's Sather's interface 
            (through C code) to the operating system, and it gives 
            Sather garbage collection, error handling, and a bunch of 
            other goodies.  This code is licensed under LGPL v3, or 
            later.

library   - This is the source code for the core library for GNU Sather. 
            This code is licensed under LGPL v3, or later.
